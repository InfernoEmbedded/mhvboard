MHV Revision 1 2010-08-25
	Added TTL Serial
	Added ICSP
	Widened power traces
	Replaced USB B connector with mini-USB B
	Replaced DC jack with one with wider holes

Metaboard Release 1.0 2008-03-26
	Added Solder Jumpers so that the assignment of USB D+ and D- to AVR port
	pins D2 and D4 can be swapped. The default is still D+ on D2 (INT0) and
	D- on D4 and the default tracks must be cut in order to swap the
	assignment. D- on INT0 is of advantage for implementing USB suspend mode
	and to keep the internal RC oscillator in sync with the USB frame clock.

Metaboard Release 0.0
	Changed routing so that signal tracks don't come so close to the board
	dimension.
	Allow 100 nF capacitor in 2.5 mm or 5 mm grid.
